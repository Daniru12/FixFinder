## 🧩 Overview: Team Roles & Responsibilities

| **Scrum Master (SM)**  | Facilitate sprint events (planning, daily standups, review, retro), support the team, remove blockers, enforce Scrum rules. |
| **Backend Dev**        | Implement Spring Boot APIs (Auth, Users, Services, Bookings), handle DB (MySQL/Mongo), integrate JWT & validation.          |
| **Frontend Dev**       | Build React UI (Signup/Login, Booking, Service listings), consume APIs, manage state and UI polish.                         |

## 🔁 Role Rotation & Handover

* **PO** and **SM** rotate per sprint for shared ownership.
* Outgoing PO/SM writes **handover notes**: blockers, pending decisions, tech debts (in ClickUp/Trello).

## 🗓️ Sprint Plans

### 🗓️ Sprint 0 — Setup & Planning

**PO = X | SM = Y**

* Spring Boot skeleton, MySQL schema, React init with Tailwind.
* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).
* Backlog creation & prioritization.

**Deliverables:** Working skeleton (BE + FE), backlog in ClickUp, environments ready.

---

### 🗓️ Sprint 1 — Authentication & User Management

* Implement `/auth/register`, `/auth/login` with JWT.
* User CRUD endpoints.
* Frontend signup/login forms, session storage.

**Deliverables:** Register/login/logout works end-to-end.

---

### 🗓️ Sprint 2 — Service Management

* Add/list/update/delete services (`/services/*`).
* Provider can manage their own services.
* FE pages: Service catalog, My Services.

**Deliverables:** Service CRUD + UI integration.

---

### 🗓️ Sprint 3 — Bookings & Scheduling

* Booking API (create, list, update, cancel).
* FE: Booking form, My Bookings page.

**Deliverables:** Booking flow integrated.

---

### 🗓️ Sprint 4 — Polish, QA & Demo

* Profile page, booking summary, service history.
* Error handling, validations, responsive design.
* QA testing, documentation, and demo prep.

**Deliverables:** MVP complete + demo ready.

---

## ✅ Definition of Done (DoD)

* Code merged to `main` via PR with review.
* Passing unit/integration tests.
* API tested via Postman.
* FE validated across browsers/devices.
* Deployed to staging.
* Docs updated (README, API docs).

---

## 🧭 Risks & Mitigations

* **Unverified providers:** Require admin approval for new services.
* **Booking conflicts:** Validate overlapping time slots.
* **JWT security:** Refresh tokens, expiry handling.
* **Scaling:** Pagination for services/bookings.

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (v1)

* Payment gateway integration.
* Push/email notifications.
* Review/rating system.
* Advanced analytics.
