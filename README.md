# FixFinder

> A web platform that connects customers with nearby, verified service providers (plumbers, electricians, appliance repair, etc.) and streamlines bookings.

## üß† Problem

Finding reliable providers is slow and uncertain; comparing price, quality, and availability is hard. Providers struggle to reach new customers and manage bookings.

## ‚úÖ Solution

FixFinder lets customers search services, compare providers, make bookings, and manage appointments. Providers can list services, manage their offerings, and track bookings. Admins moderate users/services.

* **Database:** (choose one) MySQL / PostgreSQL

## üîê Roles

* **CUSTOMER** ‚Äì browses services, creates & manages bookings
* **PROVIDER** ‚Äì manages their services, sees bookings for their services
* **ADMIN** ‚Äì moderates users/services, can view all bookings and perform admin tasks

## üîß Environment Variables

Create `backend/src/main/resources/application.yml` (or use `application.properties`) and a local `.env` for secrets.

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/fixfinder?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
    username: YOUR_DB_USER
    password: YOUR_DB_PASS
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true

server:
  port: 8080

app:
  jwt:
    secret: YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY
    expirationMs: 86400000   # 1 day

# CORS (adjust for your frontend origin)
fixfinder:
  cors:
    allowed-origins: "http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:3000"
```

**Required keys**

* `app.jwt.secret` ‚Äì HMAC secret for signing JWTs
* DB credentials & JDBC URL for MySQL/Postgres
* (Optional) CORS origins

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Locally

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
# Maven
mvn clean spring-boot:run
# OR Gradle
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Frontend (if using React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # or npm start / yarn dev depending on setup
```

Backend will serve on `http://localhost:8080`.
Frontend on `http://localhost:5173` (Vite) or `http://localhost:3000` (CRA).

## üîå REST API (current controllers)

### Auth

| Method | Path             | Purpose                         | Auth   |
| -----: | ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------ |
|   POST | `/auth/register` | Register user                   | Public |
|   POST | `/auth/login`    | Login ‚Üí returns `{token, role}` | Public |

**Sample: Login**

```http
POST /auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "alice",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "role": "CUSTOMER"
}
```

### Users

| Method | Path                         | Purpose               | Auth         |
| -----: | ---------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
|    GET | `/users/admin`               | Get all users         | ADMIN        |
|    GET | `/users/{id}`                | Get user by ID        | JWT          |

## üß™ Testing

* **Unit/Integration:** JUnit + Spring Boot Test
* **Manual API tests:** Import the Postman collection (create one from the endpoints above)
* **Suggested checks:**

  * Auth happy/negative paths (wrong pass, expired token)
  * Role-based access (ADMIN vs CUSTOMER vs PROVIDER)
  * Booking overlap rules (if implemented)
  * Service ownership checks for providers

---

## üîí Security Notes

* Store hashed passwords (BCrypt).
* Use `@PreAuthorize` or filter chains for role gates (ADMIN endpoints).
* Set sensible JWT expiry; consider refresh tokens later.
* Validate request DTOs (`@Valid`) to prevent bad data.

---

## üì¶ Seeds (optional)

Add `schema.sql` and/or `data.sql` for development:

* Sample **ADMIN**, **PROVIDER**, **CUSTOMER**
* A few **AppService** rows (Plumber, Electrician‚Ä¶)
* Example **Booking** rows

---

## üß≠ Roadmap (match with RESPONSIBILITIES.md)

* **Sprint 0:** setup & CI
* **Sprint 1:** Auth & Users
* **Sprint 2:** Services
* **Sprint 3:** Bookings
* **Sprint 4:** Polish & Demo

See `RESPONSIBILITIES.md` for PO/SM rotation, deliverables, and DoD.
